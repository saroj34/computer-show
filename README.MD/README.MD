Why is your computer so slow.(Causes and fix)


As we are  living in Science and Technology  era, Computer becomes our essential device for every one .A slow computer can make even the simplest of jobs feel like a real hassle. Why computer are slow? Your operating system has to manage the resources of your computer (memory, drive space, processing power) between all the programs that are running on it. There’s a huge number of things that may be reducing your computer’s performance.

Here are the some factor that slow down  your computer:		
      
    • Running out of disk drive space (HDD or SSD)
    • Running out of RAM (Random Access Memory)
    • Old or fragmented hard drive.
    • Too many background programs.
    • Too many startup programs.
    • Falling behind on Windows or driver updates.
    • Malware or viruses.
    • High resource usage from multiple heavy-use applications being open.
    • Some kind of hardware malfunction or mis-configuration.Special effects and visual features
    • Unnecessary services started at boot time by systemd (or whatever init system you’re using)	
      


To fixed the slow computer you should know root cause. Here are some technique to speed up your computer performance.

1. Task Manager
 You can manage (Windows; Ctrl+Alt+Del)  to end task on task manager according to high usages memory showing . (Linux :search system monitor by using window bottom +S ) you can kill the process by clicking right click and kill. Activity Monitor (Mac; Cmd+Space, type into Spotlight bar)

2.Clean your hard drive
When your hard drive memory is full, it slows down your computer because the operating system doesn’t have enough free space to work adequately. 
To make sure that your computer isn’t slow because of a full hard drive, ensure that there is at least 500MB (megabytes) of disk space available in C drive. You can check by opening This PC on window which show available and used size. In linux you can view the available and used size by opening root directory or just opening terminal (alt+ctrl+T) and type df(amount of disk space used and available on Linux file systems)
3.Empty your Recycle Bin
After deleting useless file form your device it is store in recycle bin , so clearing it occasionally will help you keep up the performance of your computer. Double-click the Recycle Bin icon on your desktop, right-click anywhere and select ‘Empty Recycle Bin’. You can also right-click on the Recycle Bin icon itself. Similarly you can empty files using trash in linux based OS.

4.Remove unwanted programs
Programs that you don’t want or need may be taking up hard drive space and slowing down your PC. To remove them, open Control Panel through the Windows search bar (accessible via the Windows icon in the bottom-left of your screen) and click ‘Uninstall a program’ under the Programs header. Use the window that opens up to uninstall programs that you don’t need. 

5.Disable startup program 
If your computer has slowed down and the time it takes to boot has gone up, it is likely because there are too many programs running on startup. To disable startup program open task manager by pressing alt+ctrl+del key. Click on the ‘Start-up’ tab at the top to see what startup programs are enabled and their impact on your computer’s boot time and performance. In linux os type gnome-session-properties on terminal then you can add ,remove and edit the startup program.

6.Scan for malware and viruses
Malware and viruses will slow down your computer if it has been infected. Make sure that you are using an up-to-date antivirus program, and run any scans to find viruses that may be eating up your computer’s performance.

7.Upgrade your hard drive
If your computer is slow when booting up, opening files or loading games, you will see a great increase in performance by switching from a hard drive to a solid-state drive. Unlike hard drives where the drive spins around to allow data to be read from it, SSD’s do not have any moving parts, instead of storing data on interconnected transistors that work at lightning speed.

8.Install system updates
Making sure that your computer has the latest Windows updates, as well as having up-to-date drivers, is important for the best PC performance. New Windows and driver updates provide performance improvements, and falling behind on them may cause your PC to slow down. You can manage your computer’s updates from the Settings menu.
9.Using secured Operating system
Linux Distros (like Fedora ,Arch ,Ubuntu  OS) is very lightweight while Windows is fatty. In windows, a lot of programs run in the background and they eat up the RAM.
Secondly, in Linux, the file system is very much organized in Ext XFS. Files are located in chunks which are very close to each other. This makes the read-write operations very fast. Windows use FAT(fat allocation table) and NTFS(new technology  file system) which are present all over the place.  On the other hand, linux is free OS and more secured so virus can’t attack then at window OS.
